## 🧠 What I Learned

- **What is a VPN?**  
  A VPN (Virtual Private Network) creates a secure, encrypted tunnel between your device and a VPN server. This hides your real IP address and protects data from eavesdroppers.

- **Benefits:**  
  ✅ Protects privacy on public Wi-Fi.  
  ✅ Hides your IP and location.  
  ✅ Encrypts data, preventing ISP tracking.

- **Limitations:**  
  ❌ VPNs cannot guarantee complete anonymity.  
  ❌ Speeds may be slower due to encryption overhead.  
  ❌ Free VPNs may have server limitations and data caps.

- **Encryption:**  
  ProtonVPN uses strong AES-256 encryption and secure VPN protocols (OpenVPN, IKEv2).
